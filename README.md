# Face-Recognition
Final Year project
Objective:

Developing a highly efficient face recognition framework to learn a robust face detection in an unconstrained environment using aggressive data augmentation and CNN.
To learn face representation from large-scale data with massive noisy and occluded face.


Specifications:
The requirements for developing the results of the project are listed below:-
Python
Jupyter Notebook
Python libraries – 
Numpy
Pandas
Tensorflow
Keras 
Scikit – Learn



Outcome:
This overall procedure of face recognition and identification system is designed using deep learning approach.
The CNN approach for face recognition can affect the accuracy of the system.
This project aims at real time recognition process where aggressive data augmentation can lead to recognition even in low light intensity.
